**NOTE** Chrome (running 48.x) is aware of syntax-suffixes and displays content inline, thus this extension is redundant.

# Inline Additional Media Type Structured Syntax Suffixes

Treat responses with Content-Type suffixed with +json and +xml as inline documents.

# Motivation

If you are trying out some GET HTTP requests in your browser against an API that uses vendor Content-Types that adhere to Structured Syntax Suffixes, then it is annoying to have them downloaded, instead of showing them inline.

# Disclaimer

I myself prefer vendor Content-Types, against the "profile" link. This browser extension just makes things a tad easier, not more "right".
